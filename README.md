# DISCLAIMER

The information and code in these repositories was placed here for my own use but are released into the public domain in the hopes that they might be useful to others.  Where I have used information from others I have tried to use and attribute it properly.  

I make no guarantees or warrantees of any kind about the suitability for any project or use.  None of it has received testing or certification for a particular use.

I generally try to respond to question regarding Energia, the MSP430 microcontrollres, and MSP432 on 43oh.com. Feel free to take, modify, and improve the code as you desire, but at your own risk.
